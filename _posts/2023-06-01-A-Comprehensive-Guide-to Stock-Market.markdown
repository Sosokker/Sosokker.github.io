# Basics

In this lesson, we will cover the basics of stock investment. Understanding these fundamental concepts is essential for anyone looking to enter the world of investing.

## Stock

A **stock** represents ownership in a company. When you purchase shares of a stock, you become a partial owner of that company. Stocks are also known as equities.

### Stock Market
The **stock market** is a marketplace where buyers and sellers trade stocks. It provides a platform for investors to buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies.

### Shareholder
A **shareholder** is an individual or entity that owns shares of a company's stock. Shareholders have certain rights, such as voting rights in corporate decisions and the potential to receive dividends.

### IPO (Initial Public Offering)
An **IPO** is the process by which a private company offers its shares to the public for the first time. It allows the company to raise capital by selling ownership stakes to investors.

### Secondary Offering
A **secondary offering** occurs when a company offers additional shares for sale after its initial public offering. This may be done to raise more capital or to allow existing shareholders to sell their shares.

### Public Company
A **public company** is a company whose shares are traded on a public stock exchange. These companies must adhere to certain regulatory requirements and provide financial information to the public.

### Private Company
A **private company** is a company that is owned by a limited number of shareholders and does not offer its shares to the public. Shares of private companies are typically not traded on public exchanges.

### Securities
**Securities** refer to tradable financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, or options. They represent a form of investment that can be bought, sold, or traded.

### Equity
**Equity** refers to the ownership interest in a company. It represents the residual value after deducting liabilities from the company's assets. Shareholders' equity is an important indicator of a company's net worth.

### Stock Symbol and Ticker Symbol
A **stock symbol** or **ticker symbol** is a unique series of letters assigned to a publicly traded company's stock. It is used to identify the stock when trading or viewing stock market data.

### Listing
A **listing** refers to a company's inclusion on a stock exchange, allowing its shares to be traded on that exchange. It signifies that the company has met the exchange's listing requirements.

### Stock Exchange
A **stock exchange** is a regulated marketplace where stocks, bonds, and other securities are bought and sold. Examples include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ.

### Market Capitalization
**Market capitalization** is the total value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. It is calculated by multiplying the stock's price by the number of shares outstanding and is used to determine a company's size and relative worth.

### Liquidity
**Liquidity** refers to how easily a stock can be bought or sold without causing significant price fluctuations. Stocks with high liquidity tend to have a large number of buyers and sellers, making it easier to execute trades.

### Volatility
**Volatility** measures the degree of price fluctuation for a particular stock or the overall market. High volatility indicates significant price swings, while low volatility suggests stability.

### Market Maker
A **market maker** is a financial institution or brokerage firm that facilitates the trading of a particular stock. They provide liquidity by standing ready to buy or sell shares at quoted prices.

### Market Order
A **market order** is an instruction to buy or sell a stock at the best available price in the market. It guarantees execution but does not guarantee a specific price.

### Limit Order
A **limit order** is an instruction to buy or sell a stock at a specific price or better. It allows investors to set a maximum purchase price or a minimum selling price.

### Bid and Ask
The **bid** represents the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a stock, while the **ask** represents the lowest price a seller is willing to accept. The bid and ask prices together form the basis of a stock's quoted price.

### Spread
The **spread** refers to the difference between the bid and ask prices of a stock. It represents the cost of trading and can vary depending on market conditions and liquidity.

### Market Hours
**Market hours** are the specific times during which a stock exchange is open for trading. These hours can vary between different exchanges and countries.

### Trading Volume
**Trading volume** represents the number of shares traded in a given period. It is a measure of market activity and liquidity. Higher trading volumes generally indicate increased investor interest and market participation.

### Dividend
A **dividend** is a portion of a company's earnings that is distributed to its shareholders. Dividends are typically paid in cash or additional shares of stock.

### Dividend Yield
The **dividend yield** is a financial ratio that represents the annual dividend payment as a percentage of the stock's current price. It helps investors assess the income potential of a stock.

### Dividend Dates
Dividends have specific dates associated with them:

- **Ex-Dividend Date**: The date on or after which a buyer of the stock will not be entitled to receive the upcoming dividend.
- **Record Date**: The date on which a company reviews its records to determine the shareholders who are eligible to receive the dividend.

A public company is like a superstar, known and accessible to the public. It has shares of stock available for anyone to buy on the stock market. In contrast, a private company is like a hidden gem. Its shares are not available for public trading, and ownership is typically limited to a smaller group of individuals or investors.

### **How can I make money from stocks?**
There are two primary ways to make money from stocks:
1. Capital appreciation: If the price of a stock you own increases, you can sell it at a higher price and make a profit. It's like buying a unique item and selling it later when its value has gone up.
2. Dividends: Some companies share their profits with shareholders by paying dividends. If you own dividend-paying stocks, you receive regular payments, similar to receiving a portion of the company's profits as a reward for being a shareholder.

### **How do I track the performance of my stocks?**
Tracking the performance of your stocks is like keeping an eye on your favorite team's score. Here are a few ways to do it:
1. Stock portfolio tracker: Use online tools or mobile apps provided by your brokerage to monitor the value and performance of your investments.
2. Stock market indices: Keep an eye on popular indices like the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average to get a broader sense of how the overall market is performing.
3. News and financial websites: Stay updated with the latest news and analysis related to the companies you own or are interested in.
4. Regular reviews: Set a schedule to review your portfolio periodically to assess its performance and make any necessary adjustments.

### **How is trading different from investing?**
Trading and investing are two different approaches to the stock market:
- **Investing**: Investing involves buying stocks with a long-term perspective, focusing on the potential growth of a company over time. Investors often hold stocks for years, aiming to build wealth gradually.
- **Trading**: Trading involves buying and selling stocks more frequently, often taking advantage of short-term price fluctuations. Traders aim to profit from these price movements and may hold stocks for a shorter duration, ranging from minutes to months.

### **What is market volatility, and how does it affect stock prices?**
Market volatility refers to the rapid and significant price fluctuations in the stock market. It can be influenced by various factors, such as economic news, geopolitical events, or investor sentiment. Higher volatility can lead to wider price swings, making stock prices more unpredictable. It's important to consider your risk tolerance and investment strategy when investing during periods of high volatility.

### **What are some common mistakes to avoid when trading or investing in stocks?**
To minimize risks and increase your chances of success, here are some common mistakes to avoid:
- **Lack of research**: Investing in stocks without thorough research can lead to poor investment decisions. Take the time to understand the company, its financials, and the overall market.
- **Emotional trading**: Making impulsive decisions based on fear or greed can lead to poor outcomes. Develop a disciplined approach and stick to your investment plan.
- **Overtrading**: Frequent buying and selling can result in higher transaction costs and potential losses. Avoid excessive trading and focus on quality investments.
- **Ignoring diversification**: Concentrating your investments in a single stock or sector increases risk. Diversify your portfolio across different companies, industries, and asset classes.
- **Timing the market**: Trying to predict short-term market movements is challenging. Instead, focus on long-term investment goals and consider the time in the market rather than timing the market.

### **What are bid and ask prices, and how do they affect stock trades?**
The bid price is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a stock, while the ask price is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept. The difference between the bid and ask prices is called the "spread." When placing a market order to buy a stock, you typically pay the ask price, and when selling, you receive the bid price. The spread can impact the overall cost of buying or selling a stock, especially for stocks with low trading volume or high volatility.

### **What is a stop-loss order, and why is it important?**
A stop-loss order is a type of order placed with a broker to sell a stock if it reaches a specified price. It helps protect against significant losses by automatically triggering a sell order when the stock price falls to or below the set stop-loss price. Stop-loss orders can be useful in managing risk and limiting potential downside in volatile markets.

### **How can I manage my emotions when trading or investing in stocks?**
Emotions can influence decision-making when it comes to trading and investing. Here are some strategies to manage emotions:
- **Set clear goals**: Define your investment goals and stick to your predetermined strategy.
- **Stick to a plan**: Develop a well-thought-out plan and follow it, avoiding impulsive decisions based on short-term market movements.
- **Stay informed**: Stay updated on relevant news and developments but avoid being swayed by every market fluctuation.
- **Practice patience**: Investing is a long-term endeavor. Be patient and avoid making knee-jerk reactions to market volatility.
- **Consider professional advice**: Working with a financial advisor can provide an objective perspective and help you make informed decisions.

### **What are the risks associated with trading or investing in stocks?**
Investing in stocks involves certain risks, including:
- **Market risk**: Stock prices can fluctuate based on economic, political, or other factors affecting the overall market.
- **Company-specific risk**: Individual companies may face risks related to their industry, competition, management, or financial health.
- **Liquidity risk**: Some stocks may have low trading volumes, making it harder to buy or sell shares quickly at desired prices.
- **Currency risk**: If investing in foreign stocks, currency fluctuations can affect investment returns.
- **Diversification risk**: Lack of diversification can expose you to higher risk if a particular investment performs poorly.
- **Past performance risk**: Past performance is not indicative of future results. Just because a stock has performed well in the past does not guarantee future success.

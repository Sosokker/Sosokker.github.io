Outline and Info is retrieved from [Introduction to Algorithms Fourth Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X) and lecture from [Asst. Prof. Dr.Thanawin Rakthanmanon](https://en.eng.ku.ac.th/?professor=thanawin-rakthanmanon) in Data Structure and Algorithm I and II.

If you want to get fully and correct material, you should read [Introduction to Algorithms Fourth Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X) because this notes is just a brief note to retrieve some info I forgot. Anyway, you can look into it to review or treat as an overview.

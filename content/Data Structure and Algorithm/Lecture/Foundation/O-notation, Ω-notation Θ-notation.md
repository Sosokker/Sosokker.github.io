>[!Summary]
> **Asymptotic behavior** : a way that a function behaves as its input or variable approaches a limit. 
> 
> In simple terms, asymptotic behavior help use predict what will happen in extreme situations such as when thing get really big or small. 
> - **O-notation** : characterizes an upper bound on the asymptotic behavior of a function
> - **Ω-notation** : characterizes a lower bound on the asymptotic behavior of a function
> - **Θ-notation** :  characterizes a tight bound on the asymptotic behavior of a function

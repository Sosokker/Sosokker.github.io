# Overview

In `Divide-and-Conquer`, we solve a give problem recursively. If we reach the **base case** (problem is small enough) then solve it directly, no more recusing. Otherwise, we on the **recursive case** we will perform these 3 steps.

1. `Divide` the problem into subproblems (smaller instances of the same problem)
2. `Conquer` the subproblem. Solve them recursively
3. `Combine` the subproblem solutions to form a solution to original problem.

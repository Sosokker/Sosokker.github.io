# Explanation

In order to generalize well, it is crucial that your training data be representative of
the new cases you want to generalize to. This is true whether you use instance-based
learning or model-based learning.

To understand this concept, let's consider an example. Suppose you are developing a machine learning model to classify emails as "spam" or "not spam" based on their content. You collect a training dataset consisting of 10,000 emails and label them accordingly. However, if the training dataset is nonrepresentative, it may lead to poor generalization and inaccurate predictions.

For instance, imagine that the training dataset contains mostly spam emails, with only a few non-spam emails. If the model is trained on such a biased dataset, it may learn to classify most emails as spam, even those that are legitimate and not spam. This happens because the model has not encountered enough representative examples of non-spam emails during training, leading to a skewed understanding of the problem.

On the other hand, if the training dataset contains an equal number of spam and non-spam emails, it would be more representative. In this case, the model has a higher chance of learning the underlying patterns and features that distinguish spam from non-spam emails accurately.

It is crucial to use a training set that is representative of the cases you want to
generalize to. This is often harder than it sounds: if the sample is *too small*, you
will have *sampling noise* (i.e., nonrepresentative data as a result of chance), but even
very large samples can be nonrepresentative if the *sampling method is flawed*. This is
called *sampling bias*.

## Sampling Bias
Sampling bias is one of the causes of nonrepresentative training data. It occurs when the selection of the training dataset *does not accurately reflect* the population or distribution of the data in the real world. For example, if you collect emails for your training dataset from a specific source or time period, it may introduce bias and fail to capture the diversity of email types encountered in practice.

To address the issue of nonrepresentative training data, it is crucial to carefully design the data collection process. This includes *using random sampling techniques* to ensure that the training dataset is a fair representation of the overall population. Additionally, domain expertise and careful consideration of potential biases can help identify and mitigate nonrepresentative data.

## Sampling Noise
To illustrate the concept of sampling noise, let's consider an example. Suppose you are interested in estimating the average height of all adults in a country. It would be impractical and time-consuming to measure the height of every single adult in the country, so you decide to take a random sample of 1,000 individuals and measure their heights.

Due to the *randomness* involved in selecting the sample, it is unlikely that the sample will perfectly mirror the height distribution of the entire adult population. Some individuals may be *overrepresented* in the sample, while others may be *underrepresented* or completely absent. As a result, the average height calculated from the sample may differ from the true average height of the entire population.

The magnitude of sampling noise is influenced by factors such as the *size of the sample, the variability within the population*, and the *sampling method* used. 
Generally, larger sample sizes tend to reduce sampling noise as they provide a more representative picture of the population. However, even with large samples, there will always be some degree of sampling noise present.

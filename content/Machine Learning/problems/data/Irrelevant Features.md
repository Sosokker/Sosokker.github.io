# Explanation

As the saying goes: *garbage in, garbage out*. Your system will only be capable of
learning if the training data contains *enough relevant features* and *not too many
irrelevant ones*. A critical part of the success of a machine learning project is coming
up with a good set of features to train on. This process, called ***feature engineering***,
involves the following steps:

- Feature selection (selecting the *most useful features* to train on among existing
features)
- Feature extraction (*combining* existing features to produce a more useful one such as dimensionality reduction algorithms can help)
- Creating new features by gathering new data

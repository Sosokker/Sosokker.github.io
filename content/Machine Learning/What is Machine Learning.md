## General Definition
Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn *without being explicitly programmed.*

## Bit more of Detail
Machine Learning is *subfield* of [[Artificial Intelligence (AI)]] that focuses on developing algorithms and techniques that enable computer systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions *without being explicitly programmed*. It is based on the idea that machines can automatically learn and improve from experience, allowing them to perform tasks or solve problems more accurately over time.

## Type of Machine Learning Systems
To categorize type of machine learning we can use these following criteria:
-  How they are supervised during training ([[Supervised Learning]], [[Unsupervised Learning]], [[Semi-Supervised Learning]], [[Self-Supervised Learning]], and others)
-  Can they learn incrementally on the fly ([[Online Learning]], [[Batch Learning]])
-  Comparing new data point to the known ( [[Instance-Based Learning]] ) or building predictive model ( [[Model-Based Learning]] )  
- Others = [[Reinforcement Learning]]

>[!info] Info
> These criteria are not exclusive; you can combine them anyway and These type of ML systems is not all of the types!


## Question Time!

### **What is the difference between deep learning and traditional machine learning?** 
Traditional machine learning models rely on feature engineering, where domain experts manually extract relevant features from the data. Deep learning, on the other hand, is a subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to automatically learn hierarchical representations of the data. Deep learning models can extract features from raw data, making them more powerful for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

### **What are some common challenges in machine learning?**
[[Main Challenges of Machine Learning|You can read it here]]

### **Is NLP (Natural Language Processing) the same as machine learning?** 
No, [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)|NLP]] and machine learning are not the same thing. [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)|NLP]] is a subfield of [[Artificial Intelligence (AI)]] that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It involves techniques such as text analysis, sentiment analysis, and language translation. Machine learning, on the other hand, is a broader field that encompasses various algorithms and techniques for learning from data and making predictions or decisions.

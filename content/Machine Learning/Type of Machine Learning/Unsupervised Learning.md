# Introduction to Unsupervised Learning

It deals with *analyzing and finding patterns* in **unlabeled** data. Unlike Supervised Learning, this work with data that doesn't have pre-assigned labels or target variables.

## 1. What is Unsupervised Learning?
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the goal is to discover patterns, structures, or relationships in the data *without label*. The algorithm analyze and *find inherent patterns, grouping in data*

## 2. Types of Unsupervised Learning Problems

Unsupervised learning can be categorized into several types:

### 2.1. Clustering

*Group* similar data points together based on their characteristics or proximity in the feature space. It helps in ***identifying*** *natural clusters* or *subgroups* within the data

#### Example
- customer segmentation
- document clustering
- image segmentation

### 2.2. Dimensionality Reduction
Aim to *reduce* the number of variables or features in the data while preserving the essential information. ***Transform** High-Dimension data into Low-Dimension representation*. Make data analysis and visualization easier.

#### Example 
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-SNE

### 2.3. Anomaly Detection
*Identify* **rare** or **unusual instances** in the data that differ significantly from the normal patterns.

#### Example
- Fraud detection
- Network intrusion detection
- Outlier detection

## 3. Common Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
Here are some commonly used algorithms in unsupervised learning

### 3.1. K-means Clustering

### 3.2. Hierarchical Clustering

### 3.3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### 3.4. Isolation Forest

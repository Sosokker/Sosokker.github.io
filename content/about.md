## Bio

I'm currently an undergrad software engineer student at <a href="https://www.ku.ac.th/th">Kasetsart University</a>, in my second years. Honestly, I'm not sure how I landed in this major, but you know what's cool? I fell in love with it unexpectedly, I ain't gotta rush maybe this is destiny. Every time I see it It's so hard to speak. Finally I know that this ain't no accidental. Yeah, I swear I'm meant to be.

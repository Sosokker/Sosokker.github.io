# Signals

**Data communication** deals with *two types* of information; 
1. **Analog**
2. **Digital**

![[What-are-Analog-and-Digital-Signals.webp | center | 256]]

- **Analog** signal is characterized by *Continuous Mathematic function*. When input change from one to other, it moving through all possible intermediate values
- **Digital** signal has a *fixed set of valid levels*. Instantaneous move from one valid level to another

----

we will talk about signal in 2 types of domain; 
1. **Time**  
2. **Frequency**

What about other term we usually here in communication; **Bandwidth**.

## Bandwidth of An Analog Signal

1. Analog Bandwidth : ***Difference** between **highest** and **lowest** frequencies*

If the signal is plotted in the frequency domain, the bandwidth is trivial to compute.

About digital bandwidth, we will not talk about it here but you can learn more [from this](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Bandwidth-of-digital-signal-infinite)

## Baud and Bits Per Second

_Baud_ rate is the measure of the number of changes to the signal (per second) that propagate through a transmission medium.

**Next, Let's read about data conversion**

**Data communication** involves the *transmission of information* over *physical medium* so it draw idea about
- Electric current, Light, Radio waves
- Digitized
- Mathematic we use to transform and analyze those

	**Data communications** does not merely offer abstract theories. Instead, data communications provides a *foundation that is used to construct practical 
	communications systems.*

----
## Scope of Data Communication

- Sources of information can be of arbitrary types
	- Understand the possible *sources* and *forms* of *information*.
		- [[Information Sources]]
		- [[Long-Distance Communication]]
	- Understand the ways that one form can be *transformed into another*
		- [[Transformation of information]]

----

- Transmission uses a physical system
	- Understand types of media that are *available* and the *properties* of each
		- [[Transmission Media]]
	- Understand *relationship between data communications* and the underlying *transmission*
	- Understand *limit of physical systems* and problem that can arise during transmission and how c*an detect and solve those transmission problem*
		- [[Frame Error Detection]]

----

- Multiple sources of information can share the medium
	- Computer network usually *permits multiple pairs of communicating* entities to communicate over a given physical medium
		- [[Multiplexing]]
	- Understand the possible ways underlying *facilities can be shared and pros and cons of each*

A self join is a type of join in SQL where a table is joined with itself. This can be useful when you have a table with hierarchical or related data and you need to retrieve information involving different rows within the same table. Self joins are often used to find relationships between rows within the same table.

## Explanation of Self Join:

In a self join, you treat the table as if it were two separate tables with distinct aliases. You then specify how the two instances of the table are related to each other through their columns.

## Example of Self Join:

Suppose you have an "employees" table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    manager_id INT
);
```

In this table, the "manager_id" column indicates the ID of the manager for each employee. The "manager_id" references the "employee_id" in the same table.

You can use a self join to retrieve the names of employees along with the names of their managers. Here's an example query:

```sql
SELECT e1.first_name AS employee_first_name,
       e1.last_name AS employee_last_name,
       e2.first_name AS manager_first_name,
       e2.last_name AS manager_last_name
FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
```

In this query, the table "employees" is aliased as "e1" for the employee's information and as "e2" for the manager's information. The self join is based on the relationship between "e1.manager_id" and "e2.employee_id."

The query retrieves the first and last names of employees along with the first and last names of their respective managers.

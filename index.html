    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Hey there, I'm Toey Sirin Puenggun! I'm currently an undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.ku.ac.th/th">Kasetsart University</a>, pursuing my first year in Software and Knowledge Engineering. I'm relatively new to this field, so I'm constantly learning about various aspects of software engineering like web development, software testing, and DevOps (although I can't claim to be good in any of those fields, üòÇ). However, before diving into software, I had a fondness for agriculture as my home is near a rice field so I always enjoyed delving into gardening too.</p>
    
    <p>Right now, my main interests lie in NLP, ML, and webdev. That's where I'm focusing most of my learning efforts to those things.
        Being 20 years old, I also dedicate time to learning about investments.</p>
    
    <p>My plan for this year is to improve myself and make my life more productive. And of course, I hope to become better along the way! üòÇ</p>
    

    <h3>So.. What does this site for??</h3>
    <p>This website serves as a platform for me to store and organize my articles. I enjoy writing and saving them for later reading whenever I feel like I interests about something.</p>
